                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <ul id="balance">
                        <li>
                            <p class="blurb">Balance provides stability & structure to a design. It's the weight
                                distributed in the
                                design by the placement of your elements.</p>
                            <p class="blurb">Symmetrical balance is achieved by placing elements in a very even fashion
                                in the
                                design. If you have a large, heavy element on the right side, you'll have a matching
                                heavy element
                                on the left. Centering is the easiest way to get a symmetrically balanced page. But be
                                careful, as
                                it can be difficult to create a centered design that doesn't look flat or boring. If you
                                want a
                                symmetrically balanced design, it's better to create the balance with different elements
                                - such as
                                an image on the left and a large block of heavier text to the right of it.</p>
                            <p class="blurb">Asymmetrically balanced pages can be more challenging to design - as they
                                don't have
                                elements matched across the centerline of the design. For example, you might have a
                                large element
                                placed very close to the centerline of the design. To balance it asymmetrically, you
                                might have a
                                small element farther away from the centerline. If you think of your design as being on
                                a
                                teeter-totter or seesaw, a lighter element can balance a heavier one by being further
                                away from the
                                center of gravity. You can also use color or texture to balance an asymmetrical design.
                            </p>
                            <p class="blurb">Sometimes the purpose of the design makes an off-balance or discordant
                                design work
                                well. Designs that are off-balance suggest motion and action. They make people
                                uncomfortable or
                                uneasy. If the content of your design is also intended to be uncomfortable or make
                                people think, a
                                discordantly balanced design can work well.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p class="blurb">Proximity refers to objects placed close together being perceived as a
                                group. When
                                spaced far apart, objects are perceived as separate. Proximity occurs when objects are
                                closer to
                                each other than to any other object.</p>
                            <p class="blurb">A very typical mistake beginner designer make is to scatter elements all
                                over the page
                                to ensure any gaps are filled. This often results in poor proximity as related items are
                                not grouped
                                — individual elements are usually spaced apart which makes it hard for the reader to
                                determine
                                relationships and connections of information. Don’t be scared to group related items
                                together and
                                then use large areas of space to add organisation and structure to the layout.</p>
                            <p class="blurb">Proximity spacing can be as close objects in direct contact, or as far
                                apart as
                                opposite sides of a page. The strongest proximity relationship is when objects overlap,
                                leaving no
                                doubt that they belong together. Using other design elements, such as lines or shapes to
                                surround
                                objects, also creates strong proximity. Lines and shapes can also link objects by
                                passing through
                                them or by underlining them.</p>
                            <p class="blurb">Shared visual characteristics automatically create relationships. The more
                                alike
                                objects appear, the more likely they are to be seen as a group. Note that similarity is
                                based upon
                                what an object looks like, not what an object is. Two dogs on a page do not
                                automatically have
                                similarity because they are dogs. One could be a Great Dane and the other a
                                Chihuahua—dogs that have
                                very little in common.</p>

                            <p class="blurb">Alignment refers to placing text and other design elements on a page so
                                they line up.
                                It helps to create order, organize your elements, create visual connections, and improve
                                the
                                readability of your design. Alignment is largely invisible – chances are, you don’t look
                                at a design
                                and think “wow! That poster is really well aligned!”, but you’d certainly notice if that
                                poster had
                                poor alignment. Think about it like you think about the alignment of your car wheels –
                                when they’re
                                properly aligned you enjoy a smooth ride, but you definitely notice when your car starts
                                pulling to
                                one side.</p>
                            <p class="blurb">There are two basic kinds of alignment; edge and center. Edge alignment
                                determines the
                                placement of elements in relation to the edge of the page or canvas. This can mean the
                                elements are
                                aligned to the left side or right side, but it can also mean they are aligned to the top
                                or bottom
                                of the page, so long as it uses an edge to organize everything. When the alignment is
                                right or left,
                                we call that horizontal alignment, though it is still an edge alignment. When the
                                alignment is top
                                or bottom, that is vertical alignment. When writing text, we usually use left alignment,
                                meaning all
                                the lines to the left of the page line up along that side.</p>
                            <p class="blurb">If your work has a strong, consistent alignment, it will look clean and
                                crisp with a
                                professional finish. However, there are some ways to rebel against common alignment
                                while still
                                looking professional. First, you can use mixed alignment where different elements are
                                aligned
                                properly, just in a variety of different ways. This can add a fun, energetic feel to
                                your work.
                                Finally, you can intentionally break alignment, misaligning one part of a design in
                                contrast with
                                the rest of the aligned design, as a way to grab the viewer's attention.</p>

                            <p class="blurb">Repetition is simply the process of repeating elements throughout a design,
                                or several
                                pieces of design collateral to give a unified look. You can think of it as adding
                                consistency to a
                                design.</p>
                            <p class="blurb">When thinking of design, we can consider issues including a core, central
                                message or
                                element in the design layout. Web design, for example, has a similar concept, where
                                repetition
                                allows for standardisation and consistency in approach. Where menu options and design
                                elements,
                                including logos, are repeated allows users a comfortable, known experience in page
                                navigation – and
                                can provide necessary breadcrumbs for users. This can be done by using imagery or icons,
                                or colors
                                or text style, to provide the user with a simplified, consistent message across the
                                platform.</p>
                            <p class="blurb">You’d expect the logo of a business to be repeated on every page and in the
                                same place.
                                Menu items are also often repeated in the same place on a page. This helps provide a
                                consistent user
                                experience. By repeating elements, we as designers not only deliver according to our
                                users’
                                expectations in this way, but we also improve their experience. Our being consistent
                                makes the users
                                more comfortable. Remember that the eye works in a certain way by default. Using
                                repetition to keep
                                the eye familiar with our design’s elements means we’re taking advantage of this

                                also use shapes, colors, textures, fonts, etc. to maintain this consistency via

                            <p class="blurb">Unique elements in a design should stand apart from one another. Good
                                contrast in
                                design -which can be acheieved using elements like color, size, tone, and more - allows
                                the viewers
                                eye to flow naturally.</p>
                            <p class="blurb">Contrast is what people mean when they say a design “pops.” It comes away
                                from the page
                                and sticks in your memory. Contrast creates space and difference between elements in
                                your design.
                                Your background needs to be significantly different from the color of your elements so
                                they work
                                harmoniously together and are readable.</p>
                            <p class="blurb">If you plan to work with type, understanding contrast is incredibly
                                essential because
                                it means the weight and size of your type are balanced. How will your audience know what
                                is most
                                important if everything is in bold? As you seek out examples of really strong, effective
                                design,
                                you’ll notice most designs only feature one or two typefaces. That’s because contrast
                                can be
                                effectively achieved with two strong fonts (or even one strong typeface in different
                                weights). As
                                you add fonts, you dilute and confuse the purpose of your design.</p>
                            <p class="blurb">Not only is a page more attractive when contrast is used, but the purpose
                                and organization of the document are much clearer. </p>

                                space (or
                                negative space) is the only one that specifically deals with what you don’t add. White
                                space is
                                exactly that—the empty page around the elements in your composition. For beginning
                                designers it can
                                be a perilous zone. Often simply giving a composition more room to breathe can upgrade
                                it from
                                mediocre to successful.</p>
                            <p class="blurb">White space or negative space is simply unmarked space in the design. It is
                                the space between the layouts, lines of paragraphs, between paragraphs, between
                                different UI elements and so on. White space does not literally mean an empty space with
                                a white background. It can be of any color, texture, patterns or even a background
                                image.</p>
                            <p class="blurb">Using white space evenly makes the content in design easily scannable and
                                significantly improves legibility. A study conducted indicates that proper use of white
                                space between lines of paragraphs and its left and right margins can increase
                                comprehension up to 20%. Such small spaces between lines, paragraphs or between menu
                                items are also called as Micro White Spaces.</p>
                            <p class="blurb">Large spaces between layouts and layout elements, also called as Macro
                                White Spaces help greatly in guiding the users through the page and prioritising the
                                focus area for the user.</p>

                                    Many fonts have distinct moods or personalities—serious, casual, playful, elegant.

                                    and “extroverted” fonts balance each other nicely when combined. So if you have a
                                    distinctive font with a “strong personality” (often referred to as a display font),
                                    pair it with something more neutral and conservative for a balanced design.

                                    Traditional publishing formats like newspapers and magazines offer good examples of
                                    how to apply a visual hierarchy to fonts. They combine fonts in way that visually
                                    separates different textual elements like headlines, sub-headlines, body copy, and
                                    captions. Qualities such as size, boldness (also known as “weight”), and spacing
                                    (including leading, the space between lines, and kerning, the space between letters)
                                    all contribute to how the eye should navigate the page and what text should attract
                                    attention first.

                                    When you’re picking fonts for a project, just think about what part you want viewers
                                    to look at first. Or here’s another way of approaching it: Decide what information
                                    is essential — what must stand out at first glance (a company name, a headline, a
                                    special offer?) — and what is less important. Then, make your font style, size, and
                                    arrangement choices accordingly. The most important textual element is generally
                                    (though not always) the largest and the weightiest.

                                    Where your design will appear should help you determine what fonts will work for
                                    your project. The text should be easily readable at the size it is going to be
                                    displayed, and clarity is especially important for small type.

                                    <br>
                                    In addition to size, font styles also affect readability. A good starting point for
                                    choosing fonts that fit the context of your design is to match the attributes of
                                    your intended message with the perceived traits of a typeface (This ties back in
                                    with choosing complimentary fonts).
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Part of the process will be deciding whether display typefaces or more neutral fonts
                                    (or some combination of the two) are most appropriate for your project. Sometimes
                                    you’ll want something that really pops, and other times the context will require a
                                    font that’s not distracting, such as for long passages of text.

                                    For large amounts of text, serif fonts are generally thought to move the eye along
                                    more effectively and increase reading speed, especially in print (though this
                                    obviously depends the characteristics of the specific font used). On the other hand,
                                    sans-serif fonts are often favored for online/on-screen text due to their simplified
                                    letterforms that display more clearly at various screen resolutions.

                                    One of the main reasons that pairing serif and sans-serif fonts works so well is
                                    that it creates contrast.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Contrast can be achieved in a number of ways, including through style, size, weight,
                                    spacing, and color, among others. For example - a bold, chunky font can be paired
                                    with a tall, thin font—and although they’re almost complete opposites, they work
                                    nicely together in large part because they are so different.

                                    When combining fonts, you do want contrast, but you don’t want conflict. Just
                                    because fonts are different doesn’t mean they will automatically work well together.
                                    Generally speaking, typefaces that share a couple qualities—maybe they have similar
                                    proportions, or the lowercase letters have the same height (known as “x-height”)—are
                                    more likely to look harmonious together, even if the overall appearance differs.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    A good way to see if two typefaces will work well together is to use the 'age'
                                    acronym. Lowercase a, g, and e, are the easiest letters to match when looking at
                                    fonts from different families. For the most part, if the a, g, and e, of the two
                                    fonts look similar, the fonts will compliment eachother.

                                    You may have heard it said that you should keep fonts for one project to only two or
                                    three. That’s an appropriate rule of thumb in certain applications, but it is by no
                                    means a hard-and-fast rule.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Some projects will call for more elaborate font combinations, such as if you’re
                                    replicating a certain look, like a fancy, Victorian-era design, or when you need a
                                    particularly decorative aesthetic. If you do choose to use a variety of fonts, the
                                    overall effect should be harmonious, not conflicting or cluttered.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    However, as with any design element, you can overdo it with typeface selections.
                                    Most projects will benefit from a more restrained, thoughtful approach. A good way
                                    to refine your choices is to give each font a specific role or purpose in the
                                    design. If you find yourself using an assortment of fonts, but you can’t really
                                    assign motives to your selections, then it may be time to cut back.
